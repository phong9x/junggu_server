Maybe it was the sharp decline in oil prices over the past year. Or maybe it was Friday\'s announcement that the US unemployment rate has dropped to 5%, the lowest of Mr Obama\'s presidency.\r\nWhatever the explanation, the president decided now was the time to finally strike the death blow to the controversial pipeline. It\'s a move that will be heralded by environmentalists, condemned by Republicans on the presidential campaign trail and - almost certainly - largely overlooked by an American public that was never really engaged on the issue.\r\nThe president\'s decision puts Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton in a comfortable spot. She had recently come out against the pipeline, and Mr Obama\'s move takes the issue off the table - at least for now.\r\nThe decision comes as world leaders plan to meet in Paris at the end of the month to finalise a major global climate agreement.\r\nThe agreement, which could be reached at the meeting known as the UN Climate Change Conference or COP 21, would be a major part of the president\'s legacy.\r\nVideo: Why does Paris climate change conference matter?\r\nWhile the project is dead for now, the pipeline controversy will not end any time soon.\r\nProponents will almost certainly challenge the decision in court and if a Republican is elected president next year, construction could yet be approved.\r\nThe pipeline also generated controversy outside of Washington, souring relations between the former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the US president.\r\nPresident Obama said he had spoken to newly-elected Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and they agreed the issue of climate change trumped any differences of opinion over the pipeline.\r\nMap of pipeline', 1, '2015-11-07 22:24:29', '2015-11-07 22:24:29', 25),
